# node_modules_recursive_cleaner
@see readme.txt

I'm sure that everybody has occasionally that situation, when huge amount of unusable or archived folders with old code, and you don't even know, where is node_modules folder is still hiding and grabbing the ssd space. I have the same situation and it's so hard to searching all the node_modules by hand. So, I wrote the util, that recursively removes all the node_modules in the folder. Feel free to use if you need.
